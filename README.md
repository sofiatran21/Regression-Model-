# Regression-Model

The regression model is developed to predict insurance charges. The data set incorporated factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and regional information. 
The goal was to find the interplay of these variables in determining the insurance charges.

The model demonstrated fairly good consistency between the training and test Mean Squared Errors, with values 0.454 and 0.435 respectively. 
This alignment suggests that our model wasn't overfitting the data, indicating a good level of generalization to unseen data.

However, a key limitation of the model became evident when we looked at the residuals. The model tended to underestimate the costs for individuals who had significantly high actual charges. 
This showed a need to refine our model's approach when dealing with the upper range of insurance costs.

Overall, the project provided valuable insights into predicting insurance costs, and we identified clear pathways for refining our model further.
